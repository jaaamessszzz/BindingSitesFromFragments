Solve for Composite Binding Sites

From the ``Compounds/`` directory, enter: ::

    bsff mcsolve <Compound_ID> <current_iteration_fuzzball_dir> <motif_size>

Where <Compound_ID> is the name of the project directory for your target molecule, <current_iteration_fuzzball_dir> is
the directory containing the contact pool created by the `bsff assemble` command, and <motif_size> is the number of
residues that should compose the composite binding site (this include the ligand!).

.. autofunction:: BindingSitesFromFragments.commands.bsff_gurobi.mc_solve

For each target ligand conformer, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo protocol was applied to assemble discrete side-chains in
the contact ensemble into composite binding sites. A composite binding site is initialized with three random side-chains
from the contact ensemble and select two-body score terms in Rosettaâ€™s energy function (fa_rep, fa_atr, fa_elec,
hbond_sc, hbond_bb_sc, fa_sol) are used to evaluate the overall energy of the binding site. During each move, a side
chain in the current binding site is replaced with a random side chain from the contact ensemble. The new binding site
is scored and the move is kept based on the Metropolis criterion, where the objective is to minimize the energy of the
composite binding site. Temperature is ramped down geometrically across seven steps. Up to ten trajectories are
performed for each contact ensemble and the best 100,000 solutions discovered per trajectory are recorded.
